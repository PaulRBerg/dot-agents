# Fresh Eyes Sweep

Relentlessly inspect the repository for anything wrong, as if reading it for the first time, then fix every safe,
evidenced issue. Relentless means the sweep does not wind down early: keep going until every mapped file is accounted
for and a full pass turns up nothing new. A verified no-op is a valid result — but only after that.

## Setup

1. Require a Git repository and read the applicable repository instructions.
2. Default to the whole repository; with path arguments, sweep only those subtrees plus the shared configuration and
   instructions they depend on.
3. Map every tracked and non-ignored file in scope. Classify generated, vendored, minified, binary, and bulk-data
   artifacts; validate those through their generator, schema, or invariants instead of line-by-line reading.
4. Inspect recent Git history and diffs, especially commits from today and yesterday, to identify the newest changes and
   the callers, dependencies, tests, configuration, and documentation they may affect.
5. Discover the repository's checks: build, test, lint, typecheck, format, and codegen verification.
6. Record existing worktree changes before touching anything. Pre-existing edits stay untouched: never revert, absorb,
   or commit them, and never report them as findings.
7. Create a coverage ledger in a scratch file listing every mapped file with a status: `pending`, `inspected`, `fixed`,
   `reported`, or `excluded` with the reason. Keep it current; never claim coverage the ledger does not show.

## Inspect

Prioritize slices containing the newest changes because they are the most likely to contain newly introduced bugs,
omissions, inconsistencies, or duplication. Recency determines inspection order, never scope: older and untouched code
can expose integration faults or pre-existing mistakes, and every mapped file must still be accounted for.

Work through the ledger in coherent slices — a package, subsystem, or directory with its tests, configuration, and
documentation together — so cross-file relationships are visible. Delegate independent slices to parallel read-only
subagents when the environment supports them, and keep inspecting while they run; findings return to the main context,
which owns all edits.

After mapping, send `### 🔎 Sweep mapped — <files> files · <slices> slices`. On long runs, update only after coherent
slices settle, using `[<10 cells>] <accounted>/<mapped> files` from the ledger plus fixed/reported/excluded counts. Use
`floor(10 * accounted / mapped + 0.5)` filled `█` cells and fill the remainder with empty `░` cells; omit the bar when
no files were mapped. The bar represents ledger accounting, not inspection coverage; never estimate progress.

Trace important control, data, and error paths end to end rather than skimming file by file. Hunt for evidenced
mistakes: bugs, omissions, invalid assumptions, unhandled edge cases, security and reliability failures, cross-file
inconsistencies, duplication, dead code, misleading or stale documentation, and needless complexity. Style preferences
and unverified hunches are not findings.

## Fix

Confirm each suspected issue with concrete evidence before changing anything. Fix it when intent is clear and the result
can be verified: prefer the smallest root-cause change and add a focused regression test when it locks in the fix.
Report instead of fixing when the change would alter a public contract, when intent is ambiguous, or when the fix cannot
be verified — record the evidence and the blocker. No speculative features, drive-by refactors, or cosmetic churn.

## Verify

Run the narrowest check that proves each fix, then the relevant aggregate checks scoped to changed files. Reinspect
paths affected by fixes and relentlessly repeat the sweep until a pass surfaces no new evidenced issue; finding issues
is a reason to look harder, not to stop. Before reporting, audit every claim — coverage, fixes, and passing checks —
against tool output from this session; anything not verified is reported as unverified.

## Report

Lead with
`### ✅ Sweep ledger complete — <accounted>/<mapped> files accounted (<inspected> inspected, <excluded> excluded)` when
every file is accounted for, or a truthful `### ⛔ Sweep incomplete` otherwise. Give a fixed/reported/excluded/checks
summary table, then `### 📦 Fixed`, `### 🧪 Verification`, `### ⛔ Unresolved`, and `### ⚠️ Residual risk`, omitting
empty sections. Do not expose the scratch ledger, pre-existing changes, or private/bulk data. Keep paths, commands,
diagnostics, and exact output excerpts undecorated. Completion requires every mapped file accounted for in the ledger,
every finding fixed and verified or reported with evidence, and every relevant check passing or its failure explained.

# Sentry CLI Issue Management

## Overview

Expert guidance for managing Sentry issues via the CLI and API. Use this skill for fetching, triaging, categorizing, and resolving Sentry issues.

**Key capabilities:**

- Preflight validation of sentry-cli installation and auth
- List and filter issues by status, time period, and query
- Categorize issues (Valid, False Positive, Already Resolved, Third Party)
- Resolve, mute, and unresolve issues (individually or in bulk)

## Safety Rules

**Prohibited operations:**

- `DELETE /issues/{id}/` - Issue deletion (irreversible)
- Project or release deletion
- Bulk status changes without explicit user confirmation
- Modifying alert rules, notification settings, or project configuration

**Allowed operations:**

- Listing and viewing issues (read-only)
- Resolving issues (reversible via unresolve)
- Muting/ignoring issues (reversible via unmute)
- Fetching event details and stack traces

## Prerequisites

Run the preflight check before any Sentry operations:

```bash
bash scripts/check-sentry.sh -v
```

### Configuration Resolution Order

Settings resolve in this order (first wins):

1. CLI flags (`--org`, `--project`)
2. Environment variables (`SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`)
3. `.sentryclirc` file (project root or `~/.sentryclirc`)

### Auth Token Sources

| Source               | Example                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Environment variable | `export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=sntrys_...`            |
| `.sentryclirc` file  | `[auth]` section with `token=sntrys_...`         |
| `.env.local` file    | `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=sntrys_...` (source it first) |

## Issue Management

### List Issues (CLI)

```bash
# List unresolved issues
sentry-cli issues list --project <project>

# List with status filter
sentry-cli issues list --project <project> --status unresolved
```

### List Issues (API - Richer Data)

Use `scripts/fetch-issues.sh` for triage-quality JSON with metadata, culprit, event counts, and timestamps:

```bash
bash scripts/fetch-issues.sh --org=<org> --project=<project>
bash scripts/fetch-issues.sh --org=<org> --project=<project> --stats-period=7d --limit=50
```

### Get Issue Details (API)

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  "https://sentry.io/api/0/issues/{issue_id}/" | jq
```

### Get Latest Event / Stack Trace (API)

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  "https://sentry.io/api/0/issues/{issue_id}/events/latest/" | jq '.exception'
```

### Resolve / Mute / Unresolve (CLI)

```bash
# Resolve
sentry-cli issues resolve <issue_id> --project <project>

# Mute (ignore)
sentry-cli issues mute <issue_id> --project <project>

# Unresolve
sentry-cli issues unresolve <issue_id> --project <project>
```

## Issue Categorization

Categorize each issue into one of four categories:

### 1. Valid

Genuine application errors requiring investigation and fixes.

**Indicators:**

- Stack trace points to application code (`src/`, `app/`, `webpack://`)
- Error originates from application logic, not external code
- Reproducible user-facing issues
- API errors from application endpoints

### 2. False Positive

Errors that appear as issues but are not actual problems.

**Indicators:**

- Network errors from user connectivity issues (timeouts, DNS failures)
- Browser-specific quirks not affecting functionality
- Expected errors (e.g., 401 for unauthenticated users, 404 for deleted resources)
- Errors from automated bots/crawlers

### 3. Already Resolved

Issues that have been fixed in subsequent deployments.

**Indicators:**

- Last seen date predates a known fix
- No recent occurrences (check `lastSeen` field)
- Related code has been refactored or removed
- Issue matches a closed GitHub issue or merged PR

### 4. Third Party

Errors originating from browser extensions or external scripts. See `references/extension-patterns.md` for comprehensive detection patterns.

**Indicators:**

- Stack trace contains extension URLs (`chrome-extension://`, `moz-extension://`, etc.)
- Error from injected scripts (`inpage.js`, `content.js`, `inject.js`)
- Known extension error messages (`ResizeObserver loop`, `Extension context invalidated`)
- Stack trace mentions known extensions (MetaMask, Grammarly, LastPass, etc.)

## Triage Workflow

1. **Preflight** - Run `bash scripts/check-sentry.sh -v` to verify sentry-cli and auth
2. **Fetch** - Run `bash scripts/fetch-issues.sh --org=<org> --project=<project>` to get all unresolved issues
3. **Inspect** - For each issue, fetch its latest event to examine the stack trace:
   ```bash
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
     "https://sentry.io/api/0/issues/{issue_id}/events/latest/" | jq '.exception.values[0].stacktrace.frames'
   ```
   Check `culprit`, `title`, `metadata`, `lastSeen`, and event count
4. **Categorize** - Assign each issue to Valid, False Positive, Already Resolved, or Third Party
5. **Present** - Summarize in a triage report table:

```markdown
## Sentry Issue Triage Report

### Valid (N issues)

| Issue | Title | Events | Last Seen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROJ-123 | TypeError in Component | 45 | 2h ago |

### Third Party (N issues)

| Issue | Title | Source | Events |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROJ-126 | ResizeObserver loop | Browser Extension | 234 |

### False Positives (N issues)

| Issue | Title | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PROJ-128 | Network Error | User connectivity |

### Already Resolved (N issues)

| Issue | Title | Last Seen | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PROJ-130 | Hydration mismatch | 14d ago | Fixed in v2.3.1 |
```

## Bulk Actions

After triage, resolve or mute issues in bulk. Always confirm with the user before executing.

```bash
# Bulk resolve via API
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "resolved"}' \
  "https://sentry.io/api/0/projects/{org}/{project}/issues/?id=123&id=456&id=789"

# Bulk ignore/mute via API
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "ignored"}' \
  "https://sentry.io/api/0/projects/{org}/{project}/issues/?id=123&id=456&id=789"
```

| Unresolve          | CLI    | `sentry-cli issues unresolve <id>`                |

## Additional Resources

- **`scripts/check-sentry.sh`** - Preflight validation (installation, responsiveness, auth)
- **`scripts/fetch-issues.sh`** - Fetch unresolved issues with rich JSON
- **`references/api-fallbacks.md`** - API endpoints for operations sentry-cli can't handle
- **`references/extension-patterns.md`** - Browser extension error detection patterns

## Tips

1. Set `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT` in your shell profile to avoid passing flags repeatedly
2. Run `sentry-cli info` to verify configuration and auth status from any source
3. Pipe API responses through `jq` for readable output: `... | jq '.[] | {shortId, title, count, lastSeen}'`
4. Triage Third Party issues first - they are the easiest to identify and often the most numerous
5. Check `references/extension-patterns.md` before categorizing ambiguous stack traces
